        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Chinmay R, a passionate individual living in the bustling city of Bangalore, Karnataka, India. My interests are varied and diverse, but I have a particular love for coding, PC building, designing, and video editing.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it brings. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, and since then, I have been constantly honing my skills and knowledge in this field. I have experience in various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and I'm always eager to learn more.</p>

<p>Apart from coding, I have a knack for building PCs. I love putting together different components and creating a powerful machine that can handle any task thrown at it. This hobby has also taught me a lot about hardware and how to troubleshoot technical issues.</p>

<p>But that's not all - I also have a creative side. I enjoy designing and have dabbled in graphic design, web design, and UI/UX design. I believe that good design can enhance the user experience and leave a lasting impression.</p>

<p>In my free time, you'll find me indulging in my passion for video editing. I love telling stories through visuals and have created videos for various events and projects.</p>
